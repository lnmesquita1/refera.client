# Refera Client

This is the front end to manage maintanence orders from Refera. If you want to check this project running in production, just [click here](https://lnmesquita1.github.io/refera.client/).
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.13.

Check also the [back-end project](https://github.com/lnmesquita1/refera.server).
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lnmesquita1/refera.client.git
```

Go to the project directory where you cloned.

```bash
  cd refera.client
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## What we could improve

- We could implement a lazy loading and paginator on the table of orders.
- Give the possibility to delete an order by clicking on delete button inside the row.
